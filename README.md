# Scatter Plot Visualisation -2022
> ⚠️ Note: This is a very old Python assignment-style project created as a simple demonstration of data visualisation using CSV input.
> It likely uses basic plotting logic and possibly outdated methods—modified library names or APIs may need adjustments on newer environments.

This project reads numeric data from a CSV file and visualises it using a scatter plot via Python scripting.
